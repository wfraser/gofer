iThis is a hand-written menu. If a selector points to a directory with a file named !menu, it will
ibe read and interpreted as a menu.
iIt allows a couple shortcuts to make life easier:
i - 'i' info lines don't need to have a selector, host, and port specified; the server will make
i   one up for you.
i - Links that don't have a server and port specified will be filled in with the server's own
i   hostname and port. In other words, links are site-internal by default.
i - Blank lines are valid, and will be sent as an empty 'i' line.
i - Do note that the file does need to be DOS-formatted, i.e. have CR-LF line endings.
i
iIf a directory does not have a !menu file, a directory listing will be generated from the files
iin it, on the fly. Currently it just generates '0' (directory) and '1' (file) items, but it could
ibe extended to recognize images and other file types some day.

iYou can browse the source code of the server here:

iThe following item links to HTTP using a 'h' type item and a URL:
