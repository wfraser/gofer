iThis is a hand-written menu. If a selector points to a directory with
ia file named !menu, it will be read and interpreted as a menu.
iIt allows a couple shortcuts to make life easier:
i - 'i' info lines don't need to have a selector, host, and port
i   specified; the server will make one up for you.
i - Links that don't have a server and port specified will be filled in
i   with the server's own hostname and port. In other words, links are
i   site-internal by default.
i - Blank lines are valid, and will be sent as an empty 'i' line.
i - Do note that the file does need to be DOS-formatted, i.e. have
i   CR-LF line endings.
i
iIf a directory does not have a !menu file, a directory listing will be
igenerated from the files in it, on the fly. Currently it just
igenerates '0' (directory) and '1' (file) items, but it could be
iextended to recognize images and other file types some day.

iYou can browse the source code of the server here:

iThe following item links to HTTP using a 'h' type item and a URL:
